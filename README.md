# Credit_Card_Transaction_Fraud_Prediction
This repository is a part of my graduate studies at the University of Southern California. I completed this project as a part of the Fraud Analytics class. 
The data is consisting of credit card transactions. Every row describes a transaction. There are 10 attributes and 96,753 rows. From the year 2010.
Cardnum is the abbreviation for card number. There are 1645 unique numbers for this field. This signifies that the data consists of transactions using 1645 different cards. Each unique number represents a credit card. 
These are the cards with most fraudulent activity.
